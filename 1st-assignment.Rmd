# My First Repo
<!-- badgers:start -->
<!-- badgers:end -->

This is my first repository. It contains several folders with assets.
- Folder `images` cÄ±ntains jpeg, bmp, and so on files that i need for my documents.
- Folder `plots` contains images that i generate through code, pussibly for publisher.

The function `print()` will display the argument on the screen. 

# First Assignment Content
# My Research Interest
My research focuses on understanding **_early markers_** and the **_genetic component of autism_**. 
In these studies, we are investigating;

- Early markers of autism in children with a familial history of autism, and 
- Autism characteristics in family members of individuals with autism, focusing on the perceptual strengths associated with autism.
